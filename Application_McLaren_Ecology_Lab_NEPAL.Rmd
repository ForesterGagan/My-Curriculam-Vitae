\bf{Ref: Expression of interest in PhD position in Ecology}

\end{centering}

  I am writing to express my interest in the PhD position in Ecology at McLaren Ecology Lab, University of Texas at El Paso. I hold a Master's degree in Landscape Ecology and Nature Conservation from the University of Greifswald, Germany, and a Bachelor's degree in Forestry from Tribhuvan University, Nepal. My academic journey has equipped me with a foundation in ecological principles, statistical computing and research methodologies. Additionally, I have enhanced my capacity with key skills in data science and programming knowledge particularly using R and Python.

  I have an experience of working at Forest Research and Training Center for more than eight years where, my major responsibilities included national forest inventory and data analysis, tree biometrics and some application of remote sensing and GIS. Recently, I am working as a Research Officer at Climate Change Management Division under the Ministry of Forests and Environment, Nepal. In this role, I have been actively involved in preparing national GHG inventory reports, Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) and other national reports related to climate change. My professional experience further motivated me to understand problems ranging from tree level computing to understanding spatial and temporal ecological processes over larger territories.

  In past couple of years, I am keen on learning statistical ecology and its practical application in forestry sector. While conducting national level inventory and data collection, many stakeholders seek method to interpolate those estimation to regional and local scale which has been a challenge for me. Since 2021, I am learning data science, statistical computing, machine learning algorithms and its application in environmental sector. I have been instructing non graduate and graduate students on R programming, data manipulation, data visualization and statistical analysis which significantly boosted my programming skills and gave me confidence on solving computational problems. I have been following the Inferential Statistics, Bayesian Statistics and its application but due to lack of sufficient experience I have not yet been able to apply these concepts to solve the research problems. Recently, while seeking an opportunity to work on an academic environment to focus on learning and applying quantitative / statistical ecology, I came across this announcement for graduate position.

  I am eager to pursue a PhD in your lab because the research areas focused on climate and its interaction with ecological processes align perfectly with my long-standing academic and professional aspirations. The impactful publications from your lab have further motivated me to seek this opportunity. I am excited about the prospect of working alongside dynamic lab members who are contributing to explore a wide range of ecological problems covering desert ecosystems, dynamics of plant traits etc.

  My extensive experience in forest inventory and data analysis has exposed me to critical challenges in forestry and environmental management, particularly the need for robust statistical models to inform decision-making at various spatial scales. I aim to deepen my understanding of ecological processes through collaboration with your lab and contribute to the scientific community through high-impact research.

  Enclosed is my CV, which provides further details about my qualifications and achievements. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experiences align with the goals of your lab.

Thank you for considering my application.

<!-- I am Prakash Lamichhane, a Research Officer, Data Analyst, and Ecologist with a strong educational background in Forestry and Landscape Ecology. My career spans practical experience in national forest inventory, data analysis, tree biometrics, application of remote sensing and GIS and carbon monitoring. I had a significant growth on data analysis and statistical application in any sector data with mastering in MS Excel, python and R programming in recent years. I am particularly interested in advancing my academic growth in statistical computing and its application in forestry sector. I am seeking an opportunity to advance my academic career through PhD focusing on learning and applying quantitative / statistical ecology and data science. -->
